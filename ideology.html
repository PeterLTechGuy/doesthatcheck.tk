    <h1>DYKSHOORNISM</h1>

        Deeply rooted in tacticism, surrealism and absurdism, Dykshoornism is in essence the ancient study of the knowledge of everything. Dykshoornists believe that all thinking, learning and communication revolve around an innate understanding of Physics, and only by applying this belief to all can one be productive in one’s society. Created by The Great Dykshoorn, one of the wisest men to have graced the students of Bayview with his presence, it seeks to extend the knowledge of humanity by approaching education and communication in new ways.

        For example, if asked to explain  kinematics to a classroom, the common physicist will adhere to typical rules and systems in the education, making use of powerpoint slides and mundane, re-worded phrases from the common textbook. However, a Dykshoornist will provide a tactical, relatable and above all else, captivating analogy that will automatically embed and incept the primary concept of kinematics in the minds of students through it’s absurdist nature, for example, through the detailed description of a Japanese airport baggage claim system. Evidently, it is a school of thought rooted in pure ingenuity.

        <br>
        <br>

        Thus, it is the manisfest destiny of the Dyshoornist Party to ensure that all students understand and are enlightened by the greatness that is Dykshoornism, and that the current oppressive nature of Bayview society must be quickly removed, purged and replaced by the peace and ingenuity of the Dykshoornists of Bayview.
