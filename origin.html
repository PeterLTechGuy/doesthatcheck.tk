	The Great William Dykshoorn, may he live forever, was born always and will live forever. A traveling, wise man, imbued with the knowledge of all physics and an innate understanding of humanity and the universe, he descended upon Bayview Secondary School at itâ€™s darkest, blessing the students with his glorious genius and personable personality.  The son of gods and father of all students, his teachings of both physics and education brought light and hope to the students of Bayview, enlightening them with the glory of physics and its study. 
	
	<br>
	<br>

	However, all was not perfect. There was conflict between students--wars that have been fought for centuries, reflecting deep lesions between all. Once united as the Three Comrades of Science and known for their brave resilience and protection of students against growing administrative control and IB Syndicate interference, wars of ego and pride between Chemistry and Biology broke out, and Physics, long considered the ruler of them all, faded into obscurity, trying desperately to maintain the peace. Hope was nearly lost, as the looming powers of the Syndicate and government threatened an end to all freedom. Upon The Great Dykshoorn's, may he live forever, godly arrival, he immediately revitalized the morale of the Physics students with his teachings, known as Dyshoornist thought. The new, united Physics camp equalized the peace between the Comrades, and while still fracturated, the camps tentatively joined together to push back against the powers that be, and continue to protect Bayview students to this day. Clashes between Chemistry and Biology students over the one true science continue as well, but although the students of Physics stay quiet, they know that they truly are the ruler of all sciences, and the one that brought them all to be. Long live physics, long live The Great Dykshoorn!
