    <h1>THE ORIGIN OF THE GREAT DYKSHOORN</h1>

        Throughout history, many have wondered about the details regarding the birth of The Great Almighty William P. Dykshoorn. The truth is, he has always existed forever and he will always exist forever. In fact, the Great Dykshoorn himself would even call the question "illegal," just like how the great legend physicist Sir Issac Newton would not question the reason why the object was set into motion in the first place in regards to his First Law. A traveling, wise man, imbued with the knowledge of all physics and an innate understanding of humanity and the universe, he descended upon Bayview Secondary School at its darkest time, blessing the students with his glorious genius and personable personality. The son of gods and father of all students, his teachings of physics brought light and hope to the students of Bayview, enlightening them with the glory of physics and its study.

        Before the glorious Dykshoorn era, there was conflict between students--wars that have been fought for centuries, reflecting deep lesions between all. Once united as the Three Comrades of Science and known for their brave resilience and protection of students against growing administrative control and IB Syndicate interference, wars of ego and pride between Chemistry and Biology broke out, and Physics, long considered the ruler of them all, faded into obscurity, trying desperately to maintain the peace. Hope was nearly lost, as the tension (pronounced "tensiong") rose and the looming powers of the Syndicate and government threatened an end to all freedom. However, upon The Great Dykshoorn's godly arrival, he immediately revitalized the morale of the Physics students with his teachings, known as Dyshoornist thought. The new, united Physics camp equalized the peace between the Comrades, and while still fracturated, the camps tentatively joined together like two masses in an inelastic collision to push back against the evil powers. The Great Dykshoorn provided divine guidance throughout the battle, assuring his students multiple times. When the students were bombarded by the IB Syndicate with physics questions that even the brightest among them could not solve, the Great Dykshoorn assured them, "do not worry, as the questions are very very easy." At the climax of the battle, the dark forces of the IB had spread throughout the entire building of Bayview Secondary School on all floors. The students were in tears and many had lost all hope. However, at this precise moment, the Great Dykshoorn uttered these golden words to them: "do not lose hope, as this is only a breezy situation, do you agree?" As soon as he finished, the students all watched in absolute awe as The Great Dykshoorn proceeded to work his divine powers and single-handly made the entirety of the evil IB forces kill themselves both upstairs and downstairs simoutaneously, all done by his intial inspection. Peace was restored and the Great Dykshoorn was praised as the glorious saviour. He continues to protect the students at Bayview to this day.

        Clashes between Chemistry and Biology students over the one true science continue as well, but although the students of Physics stay quiet, they know that they truly are the ruler of all sciences, and the one that brought them all to be. Long live physics, long live The Great Dykshoorn!
